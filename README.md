# pearls-nail-parlour-client

> This is the frontend of a MERN application that is designed to streamline the workflow of nail artists and to reduce manual scheduling. 

## Functionality
The application currently has three employee statuses and one cannot access the app if they are not added by either the admin or the manager of the company.

### Admin:
- Can view, edit, delete any of the nail artist's notes
- Can add new notes and assign tasks to any nail artist
- Can view, edit, delete employee user settings
- Can add employees to the application
- Employees not added by the Admin cannot access the app

### Manager:
- Similar privileges to the Admin.
- Can view, edit, delete any of the nail artist's notes
- Can add new notes and assign tasks to any nail artist
- Can view, edit, delete employee user settings
- Can add employees to the application
- Employees not added by the Manager cannot access the app

### Employee:
- Can only view, create, and edit their own notes
- Cannot delete their own notes
