# tech-notes-client

> This is the frontend of a MERN application that is designed to streamline the workflow of computer technicians. Say goodbye to traditional sticky notes and embrace a more organized and efficient approach to managing tasks related to computer repairs

> With this app, technicians can easily create and manage tickets for each computer brought in by clients. Instead of jotting down notes on a piece of paper, technicians can quickly enter the necessary details directly into the app. This ensures that important information about the required repairs or tasks is captured accurately and eliminates the risk of losing or misplacing handwritten notes

> I believe that by using this app, technicians can enhance their productivity, improve customer service, and ensure a more organized approach to managing computer repair tasks
